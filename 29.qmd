# Section 29 {#sec-29}

You decide to turn onto the path that leads to the right.
You stare ahead at the path. While the one turning left appears to head straight on and up the mountain, the one you’ve chosen goes downwards, cutting a path back down the edge of the great lump of rock. You set down the unworn path.

The trail is not terribly difficult, but after about an hour of downwards unclimbing the mountain, you start to get sore. You’re still pretty high up on the mountain, and you look down over the path at the forested area below you with its dense, dark green pines like tiny arrows pointing towards the sky, tensed and ready to shoot pinholes in the thick grey clouds that have gathered over the area. 

As you round the next corner in the long and winding trail, you see that the path drops off sharply, turning into a cliff not far from where you’ve abruptly ceased forward momentum, not wanting to get accidentally tumble off into what would almost surely be your demise.

You clamber up the side of a mid-sized boulder and sit on top of it, contemplating life and taking a rest after your hike. After a few minutes, however, the sky splits open and the grey clouds that had gathered start to dump buckets of water onto you. You hop off the boulder and take shelter under a slight overhang in the side of the mountain as the rain turns to a deluge, splattering noisily onto every rocky surface. 

When the downpour finally eases, you tentatively walk out from under the protection of your surrogate shelter. The smoothly carved rocky ground is slick with rain and muck as you tiptoe out through what is now only a medium amount or rain as opposed to the torrent of earlier.

You step out onto the drop-off and peer over the edge. The trees are now sparkling wet from the falling rain, still staring up at the overcast, splitting sky. As you peer over the edge, however, your foot slips on a loose rock and you lose your footing, tumbling over the edge of the cliff. You barely manage to hold on to a rock with your fingertips, but the stone is slick from the rain, and you lose your grip...
