You pick up the fork in the road and wonder at its metallic beauty. Itâ€™s a delicate golden fork, with fine, minute swirls and leaves gracing its shining base. You stare at it in awe for close to five minutes, then set it down, reach into your pocket, and pull out the mustard, mayonnaise, and pickle sandwich on pumpernickel & rye sandwich that you wrapped in tinfoil what seems so long ago. You sit down on a nearby log and eat the sandwich with the beautiful golden fork, because it is more delicious that way. 

Refreshed after your meal, you stand up. You still have to decide which path to take!
