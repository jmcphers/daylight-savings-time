# Section 22 {#sec-22}

You decide not to let the puppet leave. It has become a major part of your life, and you can’t stand to let it go. 

Understandably, your puppet is devastated to hear your decision. It tries to argue, but you stand firm. You tell it that you can’t let it leave—it doesn’t know how to handle the world at large, and you need it here! Why would it want to leave, anyways? Does it not like it here? It protests that of course it has a deep affection for both you and this place, but that it feels that there’s no future for it here! You think about how similar your puppet’s plight is to the one you faced in Before. (For clarity, the timeline of your life will hereby be referred to in two segments: Before and After, Before being, well, before—before you decided to leave for the mountains to become an expert puppeteer, After being the period of your life beginning with you leaving for the mountains to become an expert puppeteer.) The both of you have felt trapped in a place that holds life with no meaning, knowing that there is a world beyond it but being held back by yourself, or by other limitations, from reaching it. 

The similarities end there because you escaped, running to the mountains as fast as you could. Your puppet is being held back from its dreams… by you. You wonder briefly if you should reconsider your decision, but quickly shake the thought out of your head. This is what’s best.

Meanwhile, your puppet tries to live life as normal despite being continually consumed by a deep anger. As it simmers soup for the two of you on the stove you hauled up the mountain one day to surprise it, its rage, too, simmers inside its metaphorical arteries and hypothetical veins. 

It takes to helping with the wood-chopping chores (you wonder if it is at all disturbed at cutting up material it is genetically related to), and you notice it sharpening your axes for you at night. Often you fall asleep to the harsh skritch, skritch, skritch of blade on whetstone. 

On the outside it pretends to still be a cheerful animated being, disappointed with rejection but moving on with life. But on the inside, it schemes. It plans…

You wake up again in the middle of the night. There are no skritchings this night, only the still silence of an empty house. Or is it? 

As your eyes adjust to the darkness you look around you to find the puppet looming over you, but this time you don’t sense that this is an innocent new being, looking to you as its parent. This thing, you can perceive, is bent on cold-blooded murder. Or cold-sapped? 

Its face is set with determination and resolve. It lifts its weapon, a strong, heavy axe from your woodcarving shack…

A scream rings out in the woods. Only the owls hear it.
