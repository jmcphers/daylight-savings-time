# Section 55 {#sec-55}

You decide to go after the gold.

“Good choice!” says Horatio. “Gold is good. Gold is shiny. I like gold.

“The King did, too, and amassed a huge store of it. As I said, when he feared he was to be assassinated (which, I should mention, was rather common for kings at the time, particularly for the ones who, like he, who had amassed huge stores of gold. 

“The King decided to hide the best of the gold in Lake Hysteria, some ways from here. Although he’s dead, nobody’s ever found the gold, and most people have decided it’s just a myth. Not I, though. I… I know it’s true.” 

Horatio stares off into the distance, and you wonder how he died, and what his life was like. How old was he, and how long dead now? You  don’t ask him, though, for fear of offense.

“We’ll set off first thing in the morning,” he says decisively, seemingly breaking out of his reverie. He then flops over on his side and the steady blue glow in his eyes flickers, then goes out. Asleep, hopefully—you haven’t enough experience with strangely reanimated, talking skulls to know. You lie down and go to sleep yourself.




In the morning you wake up, bleary-eyed, to Horatio bouncing around on the ground by moving his jawbones up and down, shouting at you to “Wake UP, you weakling!” Jerking up to a sitting position, you blink your eyes copiously at the jumping skull, still not fully awake. “I… humbly request… one more minute,” you murmer, then flop back down to the ground and close your eyes again. 

Horatio does not take kindly to this. He propels himself over to jump on your stomach, and you stand up, grumbling. It’s early morning, and the sun is just peeking up from behind the horizon. You turn away from it, remembering what happened the last time you got distracted by a sunrise. 

You stretch, muscles once again aching from another night spent on the ground. At least the grass in the clearing was softer than rocks (though that is setting the bar rather low). “Well,” you say to Horatio, who, appeased by your awakening, is now sitting placidly on a leaf, “how long will it take us to get to Lake Hysteria?” 

“Probably not more than a few days,” he says as you poke your injured ankle and rotate it around. It’s stiff, but feeling better than yesterday. “So let’s set out now!”

“Should we pack food?” you ask. 

He stares at you blankly.

“I mean for me,” you amend. 

“I suppose,” he says. “I know this forest, so I’ll guide you towards what’s not poisonous, you’ll pack it in a leaf or whatever, and we’ll be on our way.”

“Sounds like a plan,” you agree. 

You head into the forest, carrying Horatio. There’s a path there, and you wonder just how many people have gone looking for this gold. He points you towards a bush of berries. “There. Those won’t kill you.” 

You find a large, flat leaf from some kind of giant plant growing on the forest floor, which is strange as this is a deciduous forest and that plant looks like a houseplant. You wrap the berries in the leaf, then wrap the whole package in another leaf for security. You then repeat this process every time Horatio grudgingly tells you is edible until you judge you have enough foor for a few days. As it’s getting warmer, you make a bag outmm of your jacket by zipping it up and tying the neck closed with a long, thin leaf, then placing the little food packages inside.

Horatio then directs you to a different trail, one he says leads to the lake. Carrying your jacket-bag over your shoulder, you set off on the trail. 

Horatio keeps up a steady stream of chatter as you tread the pine needle-coated forest path. He speaks of treasure, parakeets, what the problem is with soup and how to fix it, his favorite soup, lamenting that he can’t eat soup, wondering what the biggest soup is, is the ocean soup because it is salt and water and fish, which really is soup but most of the fish are still alive—but not all of them, because surely some fish die in the ocean but really the soup wouldn’t taste very good because of all the salt, ect, ect. All the trails seem the same—dense forest and an ovetcast sky. For several days you hike endlessly.

Finally, you arrive at the lake. It’s calm and shimmering, near-black, and reflecting the cloudy grey sky above it. “The gold is…here?” you ask Horatio. 

“Pretty sure,” he says.  

“Pretty sure‽” you say incredulously. “I walked for miles and miles on your directions and now you’re ‘pretty sure’ the treasure is here? This is ridiculous!” 

“Well, it can’t hurt to look,” mumbles Horatio, as much as somebody can mumble without lips.

“Fine,” you grumble, frustrated. “I will look for the gold.”

“Wonderful!” he says, evidently much cheered. “It should be in the lake somewhere.” 

“In. The lake? You didn’t mention that the gold would be IN the water!”

“It was implied! Who hides their gold near a lake, just on the beach?” 

“…Pirates? I don’t know! This is stupid.” You and gingerly step onto the rocky shore, dipping your toe into the water. You shudder—it’s ice-cold. Gritting your teeth, you gulp a lungful of air, brace yourself, and dive in.

You sink under the water with a spray of bubbles and a scream as the chill quickly seeps through your clothes and into your skin. It’s very cold. There’s no ice on the lake but the water feels like there should be, or perhaps you’re just exagerrating. You can’t tell the exact temperature of the water. 

You open your eyes (they’d instictively closed as you’d hit the frigid water). The water’s clear, so you can see underwater but not quite to the bottom of the lake. You swim deeper and look for anything treasure-related: wooden chest, gold coins, floating necklace and whatnot. Your eyes sting.

You don’t see anything and you feel your lungs burning for air. You swim upwards, and burst above the surface of the lake with a gasp. 

“Horatio,” you wheeze as you come up for air, “how do you know it’s down here? I don’t see it.” 

“I know it’s down there!” says Horatio. His voice sounds quieter, like he’s somewhere far away. “Just...keep looking, okay? You’ll find it eventually. How would the King hide his gold where people couldn’t swim to get it? It’s impossible.” 

You think, but do not say, that he could have rowed out in a canoe or something and dropped the gold in the very center of the lake, which you assume is the deepest part. But you have no reason not to believe the talking skull with mysterious glowing eyes that you found on the top of a mountain and that don’t know anything about except his name, so you dive back down beneath the surface. 

You search again and again, combing through different parts of the lake, until your hands and feet begin to feel numb. You swim tiredly back to the shore from whence you came. “Horatio!” you say. “I really don’t know if we should keep searching!” he doesn’t answer.

“Horatio?” No response. 

Then you hear a clicking, clattering sound, like tiny, light objects rattling around. You look around. “Horatio!” you call again, and, looking to the left, you see a flash of pearly white behind a tree. You walk closer, and are confronted with a large, complete skeleton, eyes glowing a familiar bright blue. 

“??!” you say, startled. “…Horatio? Is that you?” 

The skeleton chuckles, and his voice is different—deeper, wearier than the (admittedly rather irritating) skull of earlier. “Horatio,” he says. “Horatio. Yes, Horatio, ‘tis I!” 

You give the skeleton a quizzical look. He seems rather unhinged. “My bones,” he says, seeminlgy by way of explanation, “my bones. They are here, they are me. My bones, my poor drowned bones, freezing bones, bones, bones—”

“What happened to your bones?” you ask the skeleton, who is still repeating the word ‘bones,’ except it seems now to be more to himself than to you. At your speaking, he shakes his head vigorously, seeming to come back to himself. “Drowned. Died.” He speaks, but as if in a fever or a dream. “The King… the King. His gold, his danger. Not the gold, anything but the gold. The gold—you are stopped. You must not get to the gold, not the gold. You cannot hear the gold, or terrible things, oh, yes, terrible things, they will happen, they will. I was stopped from getting the gold, the wretched gold, and my bones, oh my poor bones bones bones bones bones, they were left. Left alone, on the rocks, left bones, bones, bones alone, lonely bones… but! Today, I found the bones, the bones and reunited! The bones, oh, they are now back with me! 

“I do not know why, I do not know how I was atop the mountain, but every second I yearned for the bones, the bones. Then, you came and we went to the bones, here, and I remembered! Yes, everything I remember now. And I know now—you must be stopped. The gold, the gold! You cannot hear the gold, you can never hear the gold.” 

Horatio moves towards you and, shocked, you can’t move in time to evade his grasp. He picks you up easily, as if you were a bundle of straw, and carries you towards the river. You are very confused. 

You writhe and squirm in Horatio’s grip as he walks down the rocky shores of Lake Hysteria, his skeletal feet crunching in the pebbles. “Wait!” you yell as his bony fingers dig into your side. “Please, there must be some mistake! I won’t touch the gold! Don’t do this! No! No!”

Your pleas fall on indifferent, long decomposed ears. Horatio lowers you into the freezing water. You thrash around, desperately trying to get free from his grip, but his fingers clamp strongly around your shoulders and hold you underneath the water. Your vision starts to blacken around the edges, like a burning piece of parchment. You continue to struggle, but your movements are weaker and you can feel yourself losing strength. Your lungs are burning and you’re desperate for air, but your final breath has come and gone. Its shining bubbles traveling up to the surface of the lake are the last image you see before the world goes dark.
