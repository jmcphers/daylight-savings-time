# Section 30 {#sec-30}

You agree to find his rubber duck for him. You spend weeks wading through sewage and finally, covered in waste, you find it. You hold it aloft, standing atop a large pile of the foul stuff. A bright light glows behind you, and you hold the pose for several seconds before, embarrassed, you step down and call the man in plaid on your mobile. You explain to him that you have finally found his rubber duck! He jabbers to you excitedly. You arrange to meet behind the sewage treatment plant at dawn the next morning. You have to trust that he knows what time dawn is.

Shortly after dawn, you meet the man in plaid. He seems extremely excited and jumps up and down in anticipation. You hand him a cloth bag that you’ve placed his rubber duck. He opens it like a starving, mutant wolf with really strong paws that was looking for food, found it in the sack, and ripped it open with its claws, except the man has no claws and is neither starving nor a wolf. You rethink your usage of similes.

He flips open his mobile and dials a number. After a few seconds he starts talking extremely very quickly. You can only catch a few phrases, such as "Mama! Mama!” and, “ducky! Found ducky!” and, “duckyduckyducky.” You assume that he is calling his mother to give her the news that the duck has been retrieved. All these are delivered, of course, in an overly excited tone. You see that the rubber ducks bring him joy and are inspired! 

You decide to become a rubber duck collector. You quit your job at the sewage treatment plant, buy your first rubber duck at a general store near your former place of employment, and spend the rest of the month obtaining rubber ducks every chance you can get.

After a year of ducks (you had a lot of leftover money from your sewage treatment job, it paid surprisingly well), you are visited by the man in plaid again. He gasps in joy, seeing your large assortment of ducks, and donates to you eleven hundred thousand dollars to fund your rubber duck empire. 

You Google him and realize that he is actually an eccentric multibillionaire! You live out the rest of your days among your rubber ducks and live to a ripe old age, having found your purpose in life.
