# Section 67 {#sec-67}

You decide to request to be turned into a washcloth. 

“Make me a washcloth!” you say to the octopus.

“Certainly,” it says, and waves a large, purple tentacle towards you, sending a ray of light washing across the room. “Bzzzt! You’re a washcloth!” 

You look down and find that you are in fact a washcloth! You also have arms and legs, but they’re spindly and awkward, and look like they’ve hastily been scribbled on with a Sharpie. “I am a washcloth,” you say. 

Bidding the octopus farewell, you climb up the stone ladder and out the little doorway. It’s bright outside and the golden light of the afternoon shines gently onto the heads of the verdant, numerous blades of tall grass swaying rhythmically in the wind.

With nothing else to do, you cut a path through the field, the grass gracefully bowing out of your way as you walk past.

For hours you walk, untiring. Washcloths don’t tire.

Eventually, the grassy field gives way to farmland and the day to night, and still you walk. You make your way through fields of corn and of potatoes, wander the twisted tangles of highways, and traverse suburbia, exploring. 

Whispered tales circulate of the Wandering Washcloth and small faces, candle-lit, peep out of curtains through darkened windows. 

Once, while walking slowly along the side of the interstate, a car screeches to a stop near you and a short, squat woman, climbing out of the red station wagon, reaches down and grabs you from where you stand. She soaks you with a water bottle, tosses you over the windshield of her car, and swipes you around before dumping you back on the ground and peeling off in a cloud of dust. What a strange experience.

You wander the roads for the rest of your days. It’s not a bad life for a washcloth.
