# 4 {#sec-04}

You slowly back away from the spheres, hoping that they understand that you wish to be released and that whatever they are asking you to do, you don’t want to be a part of it.

As they see you back away from them, they go into the back of the spacecraft and have a quiet, yelping conversation. You wonder what they are talking about. 

After a minute of conversation that seems like an eternity to you, one of the spheres moves away, towards the front of the ship. Though it does not manipulate any controls that you can see, the circular portal spirals open onto the wide road that you were standing on just before the spheres captured you. 

You hastily half-fasten your shoes (not ideal, but better than earlier; it’s easier when you’re sitting down in an alien sphere spacecraft, oddly enough), quickly jump down to the hard asphalt of the road below you and begin the sprint to the event venue, your shoes clicking harshly against the pavement.
