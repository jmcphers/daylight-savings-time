# Section 35 {#sec-35}

You decide that you can defend yourself in court. You don’t need a lawyer… you’re perfectly fine on your own. Besides, lawyers cost a lot of money.

You step confidently into the courtroom on the day of your trial. The judge looks to be at least a septuagenarian, with a deeply creased face and a white wig that looks about as real as her patience. A gavel sits in front of her, and you get the distinct impression that she uses it frequently and with great enthusiasm. The bailiff leads you to an intimidating oaken chair and the judge bangs her gavel. 

“The Court Shall Now Commence,” she states in an authoritatively resonant voice. It’s implied that every word she says is capitalized. “The Defendant is Being Charged with Voluntary Manslaughter. Does the Defendant Have Anything to Say?” 

You sit there dumbly. You’ve bitten off more than you can chew. You mutter, “um… sure?” Several of the Jury make forceful contact between their palms and their foreheads. “Prosecution, Please Call Your First Witness to The Stand.” 

The prosecution is a small, rather balding man with large glasses. You sum him up correctly as a man who has spent more than his share of time in the law school libraries. He calls a witness to the stand who claims to have seen the man in plaid heading to the sewage treatment plant where he was found dead. 

You start to object that it was very late at night and anyways why was he at the plant anyways, you’ve never seen him before and you know everyone that works there, you know all their names and their faces, truly you’d be able to recognize someone who was supposed to be, isn’t it a crime to break into a sewage treatment plant?

You are reprimanded for badgering the witness and ultimately given life in jail on one charge of voluntary manslaughter. You feel helpless as the bailiff leads you to your new cell.
