# Section 60 {#sec-60}

You decide to consult Dr. Smith. You don’t know him, but, based on your friend’s recommendation, it seems that he has a better understanding of surgery than your good friend Dr. Kartoffel, whose expertise is… dubious, at best.

Grabbing your frozen nose from the freezer, you plug his office address into your car’s global positioning system and arrive in about forty-five minutes. 

You walk into his office and almost crash into him because he is standing right inside the door. You crane your neck and stare at him. He seems vaguely sinister with his spindly limbs and long, slightly crooked nose. His pale, straw-colored hair glistens wetly, smoothed neatly against his scalp. He looks down at you and in an oddly high voice asks you whether you have an appointment.

You hand him your frozen nose and explain the problem, not bothering to mention the specific circumstances in which your nose thought well to leave your face. You only ask him to reattach it for you. He agrees to for a small fee.

An hour later, your nose sits proudly once between your eyes and mouth! You thank him profusely and are on your way. 

This incident has shaken you and you decide to return to your normal life instead of continuing with your candle business. It seems a much less dangerous occupation.

For the rest of your life nothing particularly remarkable happens.
