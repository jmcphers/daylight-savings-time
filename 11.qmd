# 11 {#sec-11}

Overwhelmed by the situation, you begin to scream. 

Your screams are long and loud, and the spherical aliens freeze. They seem rather startled. Then, they begin to scream back at you. Each time you take a breath, one of them starts a scream of its own, as if you are having a conversation.

They occasionally make little yelps directed at each other, but mostly they scream at you: wordless, guttural shrieks. You idly wonder how they are emitting sound, for as far as you can see, they are all perfect, grey spheres, with no sound-emitting orifices. 

The screams go on for a while and, noticing their pattern of waiting for one another to cease screaming before screaming themselves, soon deduce that this must be their method of communication! 

Do you keep screaming and try to communicate with them, or stop, afraid of saying something wrong and offending them? 

The aliens continue to scream.

If you keep screaming, turn to @sec-03

If you stop, turn to section @sec-58.
