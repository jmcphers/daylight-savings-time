# Section 34 {#sec-34}

You elect to work at a sewage treatment plant. After all, who else will?

You find a job and, after mailing the company your resume, get the job straightaway. You surmise correctly that they must not have many applicants.

On your first morning on the job, you are greeted by an extremely tall woman who introduces herself as Meredith. Her white-blonde hair is tucked into a severe bun that clings to the back of her head like a frightened mouse.

Meredith leads you down a series of long, dark hallways, filled with whooshing, splashing sounds and the scent of decay. You don’t mind it, much. In fact, if you concentrate, you can almost convince yourself that the sewage running through the filters is a waterfall. 

Meredith explains that you’ll be working on filter maintenance. When you ask what exactly that entails, she looks at you quizzically but explains anyways. She says that you’ll mostly be checking the sewage filters for blockage. She then continues with the tour of the facility; then lets you begin with your job.

You start checking the filters. You find only a few blockages: a chunk of grated carrot someone must have flushed, a beach ball, a deflated balloon, etc. You also find a rip in one filter, which you immediately report to Meredith for replacement.

This is how your days are spent for the next two years, maybe three. The job is monotonous but fulfilling.

One night, as you are walking down to your car through the fog, illuminated by a single flickering streetlight bulb, the monotony is broken as you see a man in the alley in which your automobile is parked. He has a somewhat disheveled appearance, fair hair messily combed through with fingers by the looks of it, shoes torn up, and is dressed in a loud plaid suit. He raises a hand in greeting and you sigh, assuming that he’s most likely trying to kill you. 

You try to ignore him and continue to stride towards your car. He stops you and starts to speak. 

“Please, oh my pleas! Could you help to find the duck! Help! The duck, oh it is lost! If you could find it, please, I would be so grateful, oh gratitude…” he seems to pause and consider something for a moment. He thinks for a while, and you stare at him and deem it an appropriate time to dismiss this man and continue on your way home. You move toward your car and as the man sees this, he shakes out of his deep thoughts. “One hundred dollars’ worth of gratitude!” he exclaims, waving money in your face. You lean backwards. The man seems to take this motion as a sign of weakness and resumes his pleas. 

You debate whether or not to accept his offer, whatever it may be. On the one hand, it would surely break up the monotony of your job.

On the other, you’re not sure you can trust this man, with his loud plaid suit and torn shoes. 

On the third hand, which you do not possess literally but have gained special figurative access to for the literary depiction of the decision-making process, one hundred dollars is quite a bit of money.

If you accept, turn to @sec-17.

If you turn him down, turn to @sec-06.
