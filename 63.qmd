Unable to really come to a decision, you goggle at the eyes in the sewer.

The eyes are luminous and large, and they almost seem to grow larger as you stare at them. Slowly, the eyes seem to rise, growing taller and taller, until you can see that they are really attached to spindly eyestalks. The eyestalks are glowing with the same eerie green glow as the one you originally saw in the sewer. The eyestalks rise until it is revealed that they are attached to an amorphous green blob, jiggling slightly, and emitting the green light that drew you to investigate further. Its eyes widen and the both of you stare at each other until it opens its mouth to speak.
