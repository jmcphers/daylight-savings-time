# Section 12 {#sec-12}

It’s clear to you that perhaps you should not have messed with this man. He is in a complete rage! “DUCKY!” he roars, and attacks you with a flurry of fists. You step back. He continues to scream for his rubber duck. Clearly, he is extremely emotionally attached to it. 

You step forward. This is ridiculous. You start to fight him back and soon both of you are covered in cuts and bruises. “I DOB’T CARE ABOUT YOUR SDUBID DUNK!” you scream at him through a bloody nose. 

“YOU SHOULDN’T INSULT DUCKY!” he yells back, equally loud. The two of you tumble over each other on the rough asphalt outside the sewage treatment plant. You give him a black eye. He dislocates your liver. You remove his eyebrows. He breaks your pinky toe. You remove his spleen. He fractures your retina. As you fight, you scream at each other about rubber ducks. Then you both look up and see a police officer leaning over you. He speaks into his radio. “Yeah, I got a fight here… yeah. Rubber ducks. Yes. No, it’s not a prank- would I lie to you? HAVE I EVER LIED TO YOU‽” The officer picks you both up and throws you in his police car. “I have them right here- I’m bringing them to the station. You’ll see! Rubber ducks!” He seems upset as he speaks into his radio. He swears under his breath as he angrily clips in his seatbelt and slams the car door, flooring the gas the instant he gets in his seat. 

He drives you, swearing and muttering the whole time, to the local police station to be questioned. Both of you are arrested and get three months in jail. 



Shaken after your jail time, you go back to your normal life at the sewage facility, but you always regret this interaction.
