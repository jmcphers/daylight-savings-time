# Section 3 {#sec-03}

You decide to keep screaming. After all, it seems to be going pretty well for you so far.

You make some more screamy noises at the spheres, and they slowly start to back away as if startled or offended. You continue to scream, oblivious to their reaction. 

The spheres cower in a corner and yelp to themselves for a few seconds. Then one of them goes over to the front of the ship where the windshield is, and the ship begins to move forward. It starts slowly but accelerates faster and faster until the scenery you could even originally barely see becomes a blur.

Suddenly, the portal begins to slowly spiral open beneath your feet. You jump, trying to catch ahold of anything tethered to the wall or floor that you could potentially get a grip on, desperately trying to stay in the ship. 

You glance down and see choppy, white-crested waves swirling and undulating ominously beneath your struggling feet. You gulp and try not to look down as the spiral port opens completely and you are left barely hanging on by your hands to the grey edge of the monochrome spaceship.

The craft begins to spin around, and you clutch the edge of the ship as hard as you can, but you lose your grip and go spiraling off into the dark sea. 

You plunge beneath the waves in a stream of bubbles and desperately kick your legs up (which way is up? You can barely tell anymore) and make scooping motions with your arms, but your attempts are futile.
